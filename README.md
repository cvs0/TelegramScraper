# TelegramScraper

This repository contains Python scripts, `Text.py`, `main.py` and `Grab.py`, designed to assist analysts in tracking and disrupting active malware campaigns that use Telegram for command and control (C2) communications.

### TeleGatherer.py

`main.py` is the main script for gathering intelligence on the activities of threat actors and the data they collect from compromised hosts. It has been updated with new features and improvements:

- [x] View all channel messages and download all uploaded content such as documents, photos, videos, and other media. Content is saved in a directory called 'downloads'.
- [x] Select the number of messages to download, starting from the newest to the oldest.
- [x] Save all text in two formats: pretty text with basic info and full JSON dumps of every message.
- [x] Retrieve basic information about a bot and its owner along with other channel-related information.
- [x] Existing features have undergone many improvements, including bug fixes and enhancements.
- [x] Optionally, provides a menu to choose from:
  - ***Reading*** all new messages from a different user or bot. (MONITOR)
  - ***Deleting*** all messages from the malicious channel. (DISRUPT)
  - ***Spamming*** the malicious channel with a specific message of your choice using multiprocessing to send hundreds of messages per second. (DISRUPT)

> [!NOTE]
> This script is intended for threat intelligence analysts or researchers who want to monitor, collect, and track adversaries using Telegram for C2 communication.

### TeleTexter.py

To send a message to a Telegram channel:

`python TeleTexter.py -t YOUR_BOT_TOKEN -c YOUR_CHAT_ID -m "Your message here"`

To send messages continuously:

`python TeleTexter.py -t YOUR_BOT_TOKEN -c YOUR_CHAT_ID -m "Your message here" --spam`

### Introducing Grab.py

`Grab.py` is the latest tool, allowing you to view and download all messages and media from the threat actor-controlled telegram channel. You can use this feature by selecting the number 6 from the initial menu after running `Text.py`. With `Grab.py` features, you can:

- View all channel messages and download all uploaded content, including documents, photos, videos, and other media. All downloaded content is saved in a `downloads` directory.
- Specify the number of messages to download, from the newest to the oldest.
- Save all text in two formats: clean, readable text with basic info saved in a Txt file and a comprehensive list of every message saved in a JSON file.

To use `Grab.py`, create a [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) and add your `API_hash` and `API_id` to the `.env` file. in the below format:

```
API_ID="XXX"
API_HASH="XXX"
